# unetTracker

Code to train and deploy a neural network to track objects in images, videos, or camera feeds.

The user can follow a few Jupyter notebooks that will instruct how to set up your project, prepare a dataset, train your neural network and deploy your model to detect object in images (or videos).

The project uses PyTorch as a deep learning framework. Training should be done on GPUs. Inference can be done using the CPU (slower), a GPU on a desktop or a Jetson single-board computer.
