# unet-tracker

Code to train and deploy a neural network to track objects in images, videos, or camera feeds.

You can follow a series of Jupyter notebooks that will instruct you how to set up your project, prepare a dataset, train your neural network and deploy your model to detect object in images (or videos).

The project uses PyTorch as a deep learning framework. Training should be done on GPUs. Inference can be done using the CPU (slower), a GPU on a desktop or a Jetson single-board computer.

## Installation

You can create a new Python environment and run the Jupyter notebook from within this environmnt. Alternatively, you can download a docker container and run it on your computer. I would suggest option 1 if you want to do some code development. Option 2 is great if you just want to get going quickly with you model.


### Option 1: Create a Python environment and run a Jupyter lab server


### Option 2: Run the code in a Docker container.
