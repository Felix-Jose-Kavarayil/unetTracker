# unet-tracker

Code to train and deploy a neural network to track objects in images, videos, or camera feeds.

Jupyter notebooks and Python code to train and deploy a neural network (U-Net) to track the position of a set of objects in an image.

The project uses PyTorch to train the network. Once trained, the tracker can run on NVIDIA GPUs or on a Jetson single-board computer.
