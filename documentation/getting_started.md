# Getting started with unetTracker

Once unetTracker is installed in your python environment, all you need to do is to follow a series of Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks` directory of the unetTracker repository. The name of the notebooks starts with 01, 02, 03, etc. Just go through the notebooks following the numerical order.


# Model

I opted for a U-Net a main architecture. This is a model that was developped to perform image segementation of biomedical images.

The model is defined in the `model.py` file.
