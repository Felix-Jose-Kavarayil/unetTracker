# Getting started with unetTracker

Once unetTracker is installed in your python environment, all you need to do is to follow a series of Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks` directory of the unetTracker repository. The name of the notebooks starts with 01, 02, 03, etc. Just go through the notebooks following the numerical order.

For a few notebook indices (e.g., starting with 01), there is a 'a' and 'b' versions. The 'a' version is used if you want to work with data from a live 'camera' and the 'b' version is used if you want to work from a video file.
