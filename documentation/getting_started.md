# Getting started with unetTracker

Once unetTracker is installed in your python environment, all you need to do is to follow a series of Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks` directory of the unetTracker repository. The name of the notebooks starts with 01, 02, 03, etc. Just go through the notebooks following the numerical order.
